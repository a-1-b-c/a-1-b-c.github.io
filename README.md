# AirPods Pro 2 eartips and design



One of my issues with the original AirPods Pro was how they fit. With particularly small ears like mine, the smallest silicone ear tip won't stay in my ear canal for long. I got around this by using third-party foam tips, but they're an extra expense and, depending on the size you need, sometimes require more adjustment to make them fit in the charging case.

The AirPods Pro 2 come with a new XS eartip shape in the box, which is much better. I can actually wear the AirPods Pro 2 while walking, running, and working out without feeling like they'll slip out.

Bonus: If you're not sure you want to upgrade from the original AirPods Pro for the right reasons, you don't have to spend a lot. I found that the 2nd generation XS tips fit the 1st generation AirPods Pro, and they cost Apple a total of $ for two sets. My next request is that Apple make an XL size for those with larger ears.
